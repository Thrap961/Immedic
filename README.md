# IMMEDIC

## Introduction
IMMEDIC is a platform that allows emergency paramedical staff to efficiently record clinical information hands-free while responding to situations and seamlessly updating hospitals regarding patients' up-to-date status.

IMMEDIC uses voice transcription technology to document key details while paramedics are attending to patients, quickly and accurately, removing the need to radio in to the hospital or waste time performing documentation afterwards, improving turnaround time.

IMMEDIC appropriately identifies and sorts information into the appropriate components of the Patient Care Report, and enhances coordination between pre-hospital and hospital services.
